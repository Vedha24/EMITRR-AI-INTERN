    "Physician: How did things progress after that?\n",

    "\n",
    "Physician: That makes sense. Are you still experiencing pain now?\n",

    "Patient: It's not constant, but I do get occasional backaches. It's nothing like before, though.\n",
    "\n",
    "Physician: That's good to hear. Have you noticed any other effects, like anxiety while driving or difficulty concentrating?\n",

    "Patient: No, nothing like that. I don't feel nervous driving, and I haven't had any emotional issues from the accident.\n",

    "Patient: I had to take a week off work, but after that, I was back to my usual routine. It hasn't really stopped me from doing anything.\n",

    "**Questions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- How would you handle **ambiguous or missing medical data** in the transcript?\n",
    "- Ans:I wouldn’t try to guess. If the patient says something vague like “I take some pills,” I’d record it as “unspecified medication” instead of filling it in. If something is missing, I’d leave it as null or “not provided” so the structure is consistent. Basically, I’d capture what’s said, flag what’s unclear, and avoid inventing details.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- What **pre-trained NLP models** would you use for medical summarization?\n",
    "- Ans:For extracting medical terms, I’d use SciSpaCy or MedSpaCy since they’re trained on biomedical text. For the summarization part, I’d lean on models like ClinicalBERT, PubMedBERT, or BioGPT, because they handle clinical language better than general models. The idea is to first pull out the key medical entities and then let the summarization model organize them into a SOAP-style note."

Some researchers also use CADEC (Adverse Drug Event corpus) for patient opinions. These give a mix of formal clinical notes and real patient expressions, which is useful for sentiment training."

    "**Questions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- How would you train an NLP model to **map medical transcripts into SOAP format**?\n",
    "- Ans:I’d first segment the transcript into speaker turns, then label parts of the dialogue that belong to Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan. Using those annotated examples, I’d fine-tune a summarization model like BioGPT or Flan-T5 so it learns to generate structured SOAP notes from raw transcripts.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- What **rule-based or deep-learning** techniques would improve the accuracy of SOAP note generation?\n",
    "- Ans:Rule-based methods like keyword spotting for example “I feel” is Subjective, vitals are Objective help anchor the structure. Deep learning adds flexibility—models like ClinicalBERT or BioGPT can capture context and rephrase. Combining both works best: rules give reliability, and deep learning handles nuance and variability in how patients and doctors speak."
